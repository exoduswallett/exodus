        <h1><strong>Exodus Wallet : Best Crypto Wallet for Desktop &amp; Mobile</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>what is&nbsp;Exodus wallet?<br /></strong></h2>
<div>Exodus is a software crypto wallet developed and maintained by the Exodus Movement, publicly traded company in the US. It is arguably one of the most popular software wallets, and in our Exodus wallet review we will explain why. The name implies, Exodus is a non-custodial application for managing one&rsquo;s crypto funds and keys. Crypto wallets do not store the cryptocurrencies but rather the public and private keys with which transactions are signed. While this is what defines cryptocurrency wallets, Exodus and other apps are successful because they offer features to the users .<br /><br /></div>
<div>Exodus is a multi-currency wallet, which means it can generate keys and addresses for hundreds of supported coins and tokens. To do so, though, it uses its own single seed phrase, because it is a hierarchical-deterministic wallet. Loss of this seed phrase would mean losing all portfolio, so store it securely and never share it with anyone.<br /><br /></div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://exoduswallett.github.io/exodus">Exodus Wallet</a>&nbsp;is available on desktop computers (MacOS, Windows, Linux) and smartphones (iOS, Android) .</span><br /><br /></div>
<h2><strong>How to open an&nbsp;Exodus wallet&nbsp;account?</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Features of<span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;<a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://exoduswallett.github.io/exodus">Exodus Crypto Wallet</a></span>:</strong></h2>
<div>It is full of features useful for newbies and pros alike. Let&rsquo;s view what this wallet has under the hood!<br /><br /></div>

It also updates balances and displays them as a currency of your choice in real time.</div>
<h2><strong><br />In-app Exchange</strong></h2>
<div>Another life-saving feature for a multicurrency wallet is the in-app exchange. With it, you won&rsquo;t have to go to an exchange to buy one cryptocurrency with another. Since this feature is provided by ChangeHero, we&rsquo;ll definitely give a walkthrough to it later in this&nbsp;<span style="color: #ffffff;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://exoduswallett.github.io/exodus">Exodus wallet</a>.</span></div>

<div>Desktop Wallet&ndash; The desktop app comes with a few additional tabs: Settings, Backup, App Explorer, and Help</div>
<div>Trezor Hardware Wallets&nbsp;&ndash; Exodus can be paired with the Trezor Model T or Trezor One hardware wallets for more enhanced security functions.</div>
<div>Exodus Crypto Apps&nbsp;&ndash; The application explorer has a featured app segment that offers easy navigation and cryptocurrency apps within the platform. The app is used to earn interest in cryptocurrencies.</div>
<h2><strong><br />Exodus Wallet&nbsp;Security:</strong></h2>
<div>Exodus wallet is as safe and secure as a software wallet can be, keeping in mind, as with any desktop or mobile cryptocurrency wallet, Exodus wallet is only as secure as the device it is installed on. If the device that holds a cryptocurrency wallet has a virus, malware, or is compromised, the security of the wallet is at risk. Exodus have written an extensive in-depth article on all the best practices to follow to keep your crypto safe which is worth reading for any crypto user.</div>
